# bettermacrosforadafruitmacropad
This is firmware for the adafruit macropad. It is based off of the vanilla adafruit software, however, it is heavily modified to allow an icon to be shown when selecting profiles.

This code was written by myself and Neradoc on the adafruit discord (mostly neradoc).
